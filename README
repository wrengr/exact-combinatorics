combinatorics
=============

This is a simple package and should be easy to install. You should
be able to use one of the following standard methods to install it.

    -- With cabal-install and without the source:
    $> cabal install combinatorics
    
    -- With cabal-install and with the source already:
    $> cd combinatorics
    $> cabal install
    
    -- Without cabal-install, but with the source already:
    $> cd combinatorics
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs install

The test step is optional and currently does nothing.


Portability
===========

An attempt has been made to keep this library portable, but it does
rely on some common language extensions (i.e., ones implemented by
Hugs as well as GHC). All required language extensions are:

    CPP

----------------------------------------------------------- fin.
